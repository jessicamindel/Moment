class Sticky : SCNNode {
    // TODO:
    // Override init so that it creates a flat plane at some given set of coordinates.
    // Once this works, you can write a function that adds things to a Hub, and then try displaying it.
    // After that, add other different objects, like the audio and video blocks.
    // Add functionality for placing the objects with your finger either on the screen or behind the camera.
    // Add drawing functionality (either finger or spray bottle).
    // Maybe just build the backend first? How exactly will the hub stuff work? Maybe you need to just build
    // that out, and then you can fetch the scene for a hub, and that's it. That might work well.
